# MoRE
A deep learning model for predicting protein–peptide interactions

## Introduction
We present a protein–peptide interaction modeling framework built upon ESM-2, integrating multi-task LoRA fine-tuning and LoRA Fusion. The model first applies parameter-efficient LoRA adapters to multiple pretraining objectives—covering both protein-level and residue-level tasks—and then fuses these adapters via learnable fusion weights into a unified multi-task module. This design enables efficient cross-task knowledge sharing and transfer, offering a lightweight yet powerful solution for protein–peptide interaction prediction.

## Installation
MoRE is built on [Python3](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

This project is developed using python 3.9.18, and mainly requires the following libraries:

```python
numpy==1.26.4
scikit-learn==1.6.1
torch==2.7.0
transformers==4.52.3
peft==0.15.2
```

We provide Conda and pip configurations for easy environment reproduction. To set up the Conda environment, run the following commands sequentially：

```bash
conda env create -f more.yaml -n more
conda activate more
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
